## Develop

The following tools can be used whilst developing `ezreq`.

### Development `test_local`

Run this command: `npm run test_local` to run all tests on the local machine and to collect code coverage information. The code coverage report can be found at `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.

### File watcher which runs `test_local` and coverage info collector

`npm run test_watch`

### Documentation
